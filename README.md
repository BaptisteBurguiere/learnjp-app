# Learn japanese app

I started to learn japanese and tried to find mobile apps to help me in learning kanji and exressions. However, no one was able to suit me: I couldn’t find an app to add my own expressions and kanji. As I’m writing down all my lessons on a Notion’s page, I came up with the idea to link my databases where I store my kanji and expressions to my own web app.

## Warning

As I linked this app to my Notion’s database, wich is very specific, you can’t just add your own. This app was desinged for my needs and adapt it to everyone is not planned.
